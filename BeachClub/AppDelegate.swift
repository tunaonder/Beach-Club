        All application-specific and user data must be written to files that reside in the iOS device's
        Documents directory. Nothing can be written into application's main bundle (project folder) because
        it is locked for writing after your app is published.
        
        The contents of the iOS device's Documents directory are backed up by iTunes during backup of an iOS device.
        Therefore, the user can recover the data written by your app from an earlier device backup.
        
        The Documents directory path on an iOS device is different from the one used for iOS Simulator.
        
        To obtain the Documents directory path, you use the NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains function.
        However, this function was created originally for Mac OS X, where multiple such directories could exist.
        Therefore, it returns an array of paths rather than a single path.
        
        For iOS, the resulting array's first element (index=0) contains the path to the Documents directory.
